Preheat oven to 375° and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. 
In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy. 
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts (if using). 
Using a small cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough onto baking sheets at least 2” apart. 
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden.
